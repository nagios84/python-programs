#Do you know how to figure out how long it will take to get somewhere in a car?The formula in words is "travel times equal distance divided by speed".Make a program to calculate the time it will take to drive 200 km at 80 km per hour and display the answer:

time = distance/speed
distance = 200
speed = 80.0
time = distance/speed
print time
