#Write a program that does the same as in #3, but that also asks for thr cost per square yard of th carpet.Then have the program display these three things:

#*the total amount of carpet, in square feet
#*the total amount of carpet in square yards(1 square yard = 9 square feet)
#*the total cost of the carpet


"""length = float(raw_input ("length of the room in feet : "))
breadth = float(raw_input ("breadth of the room in feet : "))
#cost_yard = float(raw_input("cost per square yard: ")
area = length * breadth
print area 
#area_yards = area/9.0
#total = area*cost_yard
#print area
#print area_yards"""
