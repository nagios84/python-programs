#    Trace the following program

n=int(raw_input("Enter the value of n: "))#3
k=int(raw_input("Enter the value of k: "))#3

i=0			
while(i<n):		
    j=0		
    while(j<k):

# What is the similarities between this and the program I gave in 2-exercises/4.py ?
# Answer - The only difference is instead of printing alphabets[i],this program will prints *

# Also write a program that does the following :
#
# Reads 2 integers n and k and prints the output as given below

integers= ['0', '1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10']
n=int(raw_input("Enter the value of n: "))#3

while(i<n):		
    j=0		
    while(j<k):		
        print integers[i],
        j = j+1	
    print ""		
    i = i+1

# Basically what I want you to do is write a program that prints n lines and each line prints a 
#     digit from 0,1,2 ... 9 one after another k times
